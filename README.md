# Labyrinth-Game
This Labyrinth Game in NetLogo was made as a final project for a course of Introduction to artificial intelligence at my faculty in winter semester of 2017/2018. It showcases
different algorithms and how they can solve the given problem. The documentation explains the problem, as well as the algorithms that are used, while Orange software was used for
comparing algorithms on different parameters and reports are shown as graphs.
